![image](codenation_logo.png)

This repository contains all the exercises developed during the Codenation Data Science Bootcamp. The Bootcamp lasts 
for 10 weeks. 

During the 10 weeks, data scientists have access to challenges, content and the Codenation Community to acquire and 
practice the technical skills most used by technology companies around the world.

## About Codenation
Through our free developers' acceleration program, we find and prepare potential developers from all over Brazil to 
compose technology teams.

Each group of AceleraDev is focused on one or more stacks of technology and is supported by a group of companies, 
which seeks to find among the participants new additions to their teams.
